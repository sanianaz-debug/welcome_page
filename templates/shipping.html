  <h2>Shipping / Delivery Policy</h2>

  <p>
    Fuvani Studio provides <strong>AI-generated interior design transformations</strong> for your rooms. 
    All services and outputs are delivered digitally through our website and/or email.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Digital Delivery Only</h3>
  <p>
    We <strong>do not ship any physical products</strong>.  
    All room transformations, design previews, and related files are delivered online.
    There are no courier charges, packaging fees, or physical shipping involved.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Delivery Time</h3>
  <p>
    After a successful payment and upload of your room image(s), Fuvani usually generates your 
    AI design transformations within a few minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some situations (high demand, maintenance, or technical issues), delivery may take 
    up to <strong>24 hours</strong>. If there is an unusual delay, we will try to inform you on the website
    or by email.
  </p>

  <h3>3. How You Receive Your Designs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your transformations are made available inside your Fuvani Studio account/dashboard on our website.</li>
    <li>In some cases, we may also send a secure link to your registered email address.</li>
    <li>You can view, download, and save your AI-generated images from there.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Incorrect Email or Access Issues</h3>
  <p>
    If you entered a wrong email at the time of signup or payment, or you are unable to access your designs, 
    please contact us with your payment details so we can help locate your order and update your information.
  </p>

  <h3>5. No Physical Shipping</h3>
  <p>
    Since Fuvani Studio only delivers digital designs, there is no concept of physical delivery, 
    logistics tracking, or “shipping status”. Your order is considered delivered once the designs 
    are available in your account or sent to your email.
  </p>
